            <p><h1>Description:</h1></p>

            <p>Thai Beef Salad is a flavorful and vibrant dish that 
            combines <em><strong>juicy steak with an assortment of fresh ingredients 
            and a tangy dressing.</strong></em></p> 
            
            The recipe begins by marinating the steak
            in a mixture of lime juice, fresh cilantro, mint leaves, sugar, fish
            sauce, green onions, lemongrass, and sweet chili sauce. This marinade 
            infuses the meat with a burst of <em>aromatic and tangy</em> flavors. The steak is
            then <em>grilled to perfection, resulting in tender and flavorful slices</em>. The 
            salad base consists of leaf lettuce, providing a <em>crisp and refreshing</em> backdrop.
            Tossed in with the lettuce are diced English cucumber and halved cherry tomatoes,
            which add a <em>cool and juicy</em> element. The salad is dressed with the remaining marinade,
            creating a <em>zesty and savory</em> dressing that ties all the flavors together. 
            Garnished with additional fresh cilantro, this Thai Beef Salad is a <em>harmonious blend of
            sweet, tangy, and herbal flavors</em>. It is a satisfying and vibrant dish that is perfect
            for a light lunch or dinner option with a delightful Thai twist.

            <p><h1>Steps:</h1></p>

            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix lime juice, cilantro, mint leaves, sugar, fish sauce, green onions,
                    lemongrass, and chili sauce together in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved.
                    Adjust the flavor, if desired, by adding more sugar and/or fish sauce; set aside.</li>
                    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate</li>
                    <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill until it begins to firm and is hot
                    and slightly pink in the center, about 4 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer
